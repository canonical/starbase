How to create a new project

I will eventually turn this into a template repository from which you can fork. The important steps to remember even after that are:

1. Ensure the ``LICENSE`` file represents the current best practices from the Canonical legal team for the specific project you intend to release.
2. Rename any files or directories and ensure references are updated.
3. Write a new README!
